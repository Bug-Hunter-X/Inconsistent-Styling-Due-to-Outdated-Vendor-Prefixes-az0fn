The CSS code uses a vendor prefix that is no longer necessary or supported, causing the style to not apply correctly in some browsers. For example, using `-webkit-transform` instead of `transform` can lead to issues in browsers that don't require the prefix, like Firefox or Edge. Another example is using `-ms-flexbox` instead of `display: flex`.  This can cause unexpected layout issues across different browsers.
